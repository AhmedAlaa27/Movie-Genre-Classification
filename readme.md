# Movie Genre Classification ðŸŽ¬

This project aims to classify movies into genres based on their descriptions using machine learning models. By leveraging text processing and classification techniques, the project provides insights into how descriptive text can be used to predict a movie's genre.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: The model was trained on a dataset containing movie descriptions and corresponding genres.
- **Techniques**: Text preprocessing, TF-IDF Vectorization, and classification using machine learning algorithms.
- **Classifier Used**: Logistic Regression

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    
    - Cleaned the text data by removing stop words, special characters, and performing text normalization.
    - Applied **TF-IDF Vectorization** to transform the text into numerical features.
2. **Model Training**:
    
    - Split the data into training and testing sets.
    - Trained a Logistic Regression model on the training data to predict movie genres.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of text processing and machine learning in predicting movie genres from their descriptions. The results highlight the potential of machine learning models in understanding and classifying textual data.
